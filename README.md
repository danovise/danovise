Hi, Iâ€™m Daria Sechko. 

I am a qualified iOS developer with experience in Swift mobile app development. Before becoming a developer, I worked as a product manager for a company with a medical profile. It helps me understand product and business goals, as well as thinking about the app from the customer's point of view. 

You can contact me using Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/danovise) or gmail (dar.sechko@gmail.com)

I will be glad to cooperate!
