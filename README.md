Hi, Iâ€™m Daria Sechko. I am a qualified iOS developer with experience in Swift mobile app development. Before becoming a developer, I worked as a product manager for a company with a medical profile. It helps me understand product and business goals, as well as thinking about the app from the customer's point of view. 

Development environment: Xcode

Languages: Swift

UI Frameworks: SwiftUI, UIKit

Stack Technologies: Code layout, Auto layout, Git, SnapKit, JSON, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), R.Swift, URLSession, SDWebImage, Table / Scroll / Collection View, UITabBarController

Architectures and patterns: MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER

English: B1 

I follow new technologies and try to keep up with trends in mobile development. I tend to learn new things quickly and easily, and I am easy to learn and work with large amounts of information. In my work with partners and colleagues I show good communication skills.
